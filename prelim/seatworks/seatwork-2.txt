- It should show an error if input is 0 or negative
- It should allow user to select with the ff:
    - Pressing "1" means calculate the perimeter
    - Pressing "2" means calculate the area

Perimeter of square = 4s
Area of square = s^2

Example result:

Select `1` to calculate perimeter of square, `2` to calculate area of square: 2
Input the side of the square: 5

Area is: 25
