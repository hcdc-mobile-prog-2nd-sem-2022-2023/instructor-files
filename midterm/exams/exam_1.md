Exam No. 1

Given the following program:

```
void main() {
  final person = {
    'name': 'Andrea',
    'age': 36,
    'height': 1.84
  };
  print("My name is ${person['name']}. I'm ${person['age']} years old, I'm ${person['height']} meters tall.");
}
```

Refactor this code by creating a Person class that will contain name, age, height properties.

This class should have a printDescription() method that can be used to print the name, age and height just like in the program above.

Once this is done, create two instances of Person and use them to call the printDescription() method just created.
